This is an Android space shooter I created in 2020 using LibGDX and Android Studio.

## Installation
1. Download [astro-envoys.apk](./astro-envoys.apk) to your Android device
2. Locate the .apk file in your downloads or file system
3. Open the .apk file and install the application from (don't worry, it's safe)
4. Play the game!

I do not plan on uploading this game to Google Play so it must be manually installed.

## Features
- 5 types of enemies, including 1 boss
- 5 different unlockable weapon systems
