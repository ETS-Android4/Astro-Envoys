This is an Android space shooter I created in 2020 using LibGDX and Android Studio.

## Installation
1. Download [astro-envoys.apk](./astro-envoys.apk) to your Android device
2. Locate the .apk file in your downloads or file system
3. Open the .apk file and install the application from (don't worry, it's safe)

I do not plan on uploading this game to Google Play so it must be manually installed.
